This code generates a horizontal coloured real time bargraph generator anim for a Macbook Pro 13 inch, OSX 10.7.5, using the default standard Terminal only.\n\nIt is UNTESTED on Linux variants but I would like any successful Linux tryers to make a comment in the comments section and tags will be added accordingly otherwise I will assume it does NOT work on other UNIX like variants.\n\nIt is a derivative of my 7 bit bargraph generator for Python on this site elsewhere.\n\nThe Terminal colours WILL be changed on running but it is simple to return it back to its original state.\n\nRead the code for more information.\n\nEnjoy, (and a Happy New Year)...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
