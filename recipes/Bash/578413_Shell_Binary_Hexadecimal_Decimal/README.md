This little DEMO may be common knowledge to the big guns but not to amateurs like myself, so......\n\nThis is an Apple Macbbok Shell/Terminal DEMO shell script to show how to:-\n\n1) Create a binary file...\n2) Save it to your DEFAULT /directory/drwawer/folder/...\n3) Display a hexadecimal dump of said binary file to prove that it is binary...\n4) Select a single BYTE of that file and save it as an ASCII text decimal _number_, also to your DEFAULT /directory/drawer/folder/...\n5) Read this ASCII text decimal number back in again...\n6) Add this string representation to a number...\n7) Stop...\n\nIt was intended purely for OSX 10.7.5 and above using the default terminal and shell...\n\nIt does work on many Linux flavours and shells/terminals also however.\n\nWritten so the anyone can understand what is going on.\n\nThe two files generated and saved in this DEMO to your DEFAULT /directory/drawer/folder/ are:-\n\nBinaryString.dat\nBinaryString.txt\n\nThis WILL lead to something very unusual in the not too distant future...\n\nThis is Public Domain and you may do with it as you wish...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
