A very simple crude sinewave generator using a BASH script inside a Linux Terminal.\n\nThe file required is generated inside the code and requires /dev/audio to work.\n\nEnsure you have this device, if not the download oss-compat from your OS's repository...\n\nIt lasts for about 8 seconds before exiting and saves a 65536 byte file to your working directory/drawer/folder as sinewave.raw.\n\nUse an oscilloscope to check the waveform generated...\n\nIt is entirely Public Domain and you may do with it as you please...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
