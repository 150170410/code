This is probably common knowledge to the professionals but not so much for amateurs like myself.\n\nThis is a code snippet for the equivalent of BASIC's...\n\nLET char$=INKEY$\n\nAs the timeout parameter cannot be less than 1 second then this is the only limitation...\n\nIt is a single line function which has a variable "char"...\n\nRead the code for more information...\n\nThere are now two versions, edit out and choose which is best for you...
