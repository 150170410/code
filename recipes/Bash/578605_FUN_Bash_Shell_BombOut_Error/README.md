Do you remember the Bomb-Out icon(s) that appeared on some computers' SW and HW many years ago...\n\nWell this is a matching sound to go with it and can be used as a critical error sound.\n\nIt sounds like a bomb being dropped from an aeroplane and is purely a shell sript only.\n\nIt is set up to run SOund eXchange, SOX, but just by editing the code "/dev/dsp" can be used instead.\n\nRead the code for more informastion.\n\nEnjoy...\n\nBazza...\n
