32 bit Windows to Windows 7...\n\nThis batch file generates a 65536 byte binary file to give 8 seconds of pure sinewave at the earphone/speaker output(s)...\n\nIt uses ONLY a default Windows 32 bit installation, to Windows 7, except for the installation of SOX...\n\nObtain SOX from here:-\n\nhttp://sox.sourceforge.net/\n\nNotepad was the _main_ editor... ;o)\n\nHopefully the code section does NOT corrupt the binary part which is 8 bytes in size.\nIf it does then let me know on here and I will post a pointer from where to grab it...\n\nEnjoy...\n
