CSS snippet for a 3-column grid. Based on that used for some Apple product pages.\n\nHTML:\n\n    <div class="grid3col">\n      <div class="column first">\n        ...\n      </div>\n      <div class="column">\n        ...\n      </div>\n      <div class="column last">\n        ...\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nIn general, you have to recalculate the widths based on (a) the available full width in your pages and (b) the amount a spacing you want between columns.
