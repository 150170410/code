Komodo projects look like file managers, but don't always offer the same functionality directly.\nHere's a macro that makes a copy of the current selected file in a project.  To use it,\ncreate a new macro in the Komodo toolbox, copy this code, paste it in the macro, and save it.\nThen you can select a file, double-click the macro icon (or assign it to a keybinding),\nand Komodo will create a copy of the file called "Copy of <basename>.<extension>".
