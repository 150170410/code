This Komodo macro moves the line containing the caret (cursor) up one line,\nand then puts the caret at the start of that line in its new position.\nPut the macro in your toolbox, and bind it to Ctrl-Shift-UpArrow\n(unused in the default Komodo keybinding set) to get the same\nfunctionality as in some other popular editors).
