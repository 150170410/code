With this macro, you can make a text/word selection, then press one of  ", ', (, [ or {  and the matching set of quotes/braces will be added around the selection.\n\nExample (where | denotes the selection):\n   This is |myselectedword|.\nthen pressing "{" you'll get:\n   This is {myselectedword}.\n
