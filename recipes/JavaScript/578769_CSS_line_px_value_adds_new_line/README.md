Put your cursor on a CSS line that ends with a value in px (do not select any text). Run the script and it will insert a new line there the px value is converted to a rem value. \n\nYou need to edit the code to modify your rem base matching the one you use in your own CSS. The default value is 16.\n\nExample: \nfont-size: 12px; (run the script with the cursor in this line)\nfont-size: 0.75rem (new line added by script) \n
