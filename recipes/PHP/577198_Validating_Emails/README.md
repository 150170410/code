a small script that can be used for Validating Emails on \n - Login pages\n - forums \n\n\n\nchanged to preg_match from eregi function. now scripted validates everything typed in input boxes \n\nOld Code = \n\n\n           foreach($Email as $Emails)\n\t   { // checks Emails - .net , .com , .au  & etc\n\t   if(eregi("[a-zA-Z0-9]@+[a-z].{1,}com$",trim($Emails))|| eregi(            \n           "[a-zA-Z0-9]@+[a-z].{1,}net$",trim($Emails)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Code = \n\n\n\n\n           foreach($Email as $Emails)\n\t   { // checks Emails - .net , .com , .au  & etc\n\t   if(!preg_match("/^[_\\.0-9a-zA-Z-]+@([0-9a-zA-Z]\n\t   [0-9a-zA-Z-]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/i", $Emails))\n\ni changed from eregi function to preg_match function because eregi was taking out of PHP version 5.3.0 and 5.3.5.
