"This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that \\\nuses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server \\\nor client. IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one \\\nneeds to write a full-featured SSL client or server application: \\\nmultiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and \\\nSSL version selection. As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with \\\nmod_perl."
