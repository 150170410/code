Maybe not too sophisticated, but a handy little tool I use for myself.\n\nThis program does the three essential tasks that (at least) I need:\n1. Unzip an archive to a folder\n2. Zip a folder to an archive\n3. Zip a (big) file to an archive\n\nFreeze it, drop it into the 'sendto' folder, and you have a very convenient way to use this program via right mouseclick/sendto->zip2folder.
