One liner code to shift each char of a string by some passed value\nvery simple encryption :)\nadded version 2 fixing following bugs:\n1. Capital chars are shifted correctly.\n2. Only alpha numeric chars are shifted.\n3. No hard-coded numbers so that as long as first alphabet is 'a'\n   and last 'z' it will work :)
