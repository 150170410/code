is a very simple templating-system.\nthe goals of this 'system' were\n- easy to use and to learn\n  cheetah and yaptu for example was much to complex to\n  install and learn and did a lot of things i didnt need.\n- easy to change.\n  blender is going to be used and serviced by python newbies.\n  there is absolutely no chance to have something like\n  complex regexes, evaluation or automatically including\n  the namespaces and the like.\n- much cooler name than 'yaptu' ;-)
