Doctest and unittest are like 2 extremes of testing your python\ncode. One is simple and intuitive and the other is powerful and\nrequires more formality. In Python 2.4, doctest, builds in some of the\npower of unittest, perhaps bridging the gap between the two. This\nexample shows you how to use doctest and the doctest.DocFileSuite\nfeature.
