An example done to solve this problem:\n\nhttp://acm.uva.es/p/v1/101.html\n\nAnimation by vpython (visual python): http://vpython.org/\n\nProvides some 3d coolness for new pythonists. Shows some stack usage. Probably should be shorter.\n\nIn the __main__ statement at the bottom, replace test2() with parse(), then type something like this on each line:\n10\nmove 5 onto 1\npile 1 onto 3\nmove 6 over 2\npile 3 over 2\netc.\n\nSee the problem link at the top for full instructions...
