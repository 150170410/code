A very-very simple dice game:\ntwo persons("You" and "CPU") are dropping dices.\nIf someone scores 17 during dropping dices, he wins.\nAny doubts are interpreted to a humans` side.\n(i`m too lasy to add draw here)\nAnd one more. Rules say- "if someone drops 3 same dices at the beginning, he wins."\nthis is not realized in game, too. (but the probability of this is just about 1.4%)
