Unpickling from an untrusted source, such as a network connection, can allow maliciously formed pickles to run arbitrary code.\n\nThis recipe presents a simple solution for serializing and unserializing simple Python types. Only simple Python types can be serialized, which makes the use of this algorithm safer than using the pickle module.\n\nNB: I've changes this recipe drastically. It used to use a rather slow string slicing technique, which was a very bad example of how to use strings in Python! The cStringIO provided a faster, simpler replacement. This recipe now serializes faster than the Pickle module (not cPickle).\n\nNB: A Python 2.4 version of this recipe is available here:\nhttp://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/415791
