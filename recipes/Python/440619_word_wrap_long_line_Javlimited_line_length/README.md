This recipe is based off of\nhttp://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/148061\n\nI found and used the recipe above, however, I took issue with the results.  See, I wanted to use it on a big Java file that had lots of long lines.  With extra long package names, and extra long lines containing multiple semicolons without spaces after them, I found it necessary to modify this algorithm to suit my specific purposes.\n\nIf you have a line like this:\n\nimport com.jobsintheus.vaccinium.controller.ejb.stateful.VacciniumStatefulSessionRemoteHome;\n\nyou're going to have problems using the above algorithm, but the one herein does something useful with that - splitting the line on the periods too.  It works for semicolons too.\n\nInserted line breaks will become the visible backslash charater plus the line break.\n\nOtherwise, line breaks that existed before stay as is (with no visible backslash character).\n\nThe point is to have the Java code be a readable addition as an input file to (la)tex verbatim.
