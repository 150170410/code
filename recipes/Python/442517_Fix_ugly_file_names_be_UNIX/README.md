You have files named with funky characters lying around in your\nfilesystem.  Ugly files like "My Document #3 - (2005)[1].txt" are\ncommon when you're sharing directories with Windows users, but you\nwould like to have them renamed to something like\n"my_document_3_-_2005-1-.txt" so that your shell and other unix\nutilities won't have to deal with special characters.
