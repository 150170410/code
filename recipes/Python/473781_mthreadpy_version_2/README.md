This program demonstrates code ported from C to Python.\n1. The port is not very pythonic (see the first version for that).\n2. The port is almost a straight line-by-line translation of code.\n3. The code came from OPERATING SYSTEMS: Third Edition (by GARY NUTT).\n4. The code involves LAB EXERCISE 2.2 (on pages 83 -- 88).
