This is a simple console application that you can use to schedule iTunes to begin playing a playlist at a certain time.\nThe volume ramps up to full level over about 1 minute so you aren't blasted awake.\n\nI haven't worked with Python much so any suggestions, comments are appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nJosh
