Presented here are two modules, "html_help" & "Zam".\nBoth modules contain two classes.\n\n"html_help" contains "html_table" and "html_month".\nA html_table produces tables with a readable format.\nA html_month is just a logical extention of the html_table.\n\n"Zam" contains "array" and "matrix".\nAn array is 1D list with fixed sized and mutable internals.\nA matrix is the same except for the fact that it is 2D.
