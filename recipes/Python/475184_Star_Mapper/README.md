The following recipe demonstrates the use of SETs in Python.\nThe scenario that this was written for is as follows:\n\nA star map is given according to the format X,Y,Z|...|X,Y,Z:\nX represents the X coordinate of the star (which may be any real integer).\nY represents the Y coordinate on the star (which may be any real integer).\nZ represents the color of the star (which may be any real integer larger than 0).\n| separates the stars (strings represented by X,Y,Z).\n, separates the numbers describing the stars (X,Y,Z).\n: represents the end of the star map string.\n... is an arbitrary number of X,Y,Z strings with appropriate pipes.\n\nThe problem involves finding all constellations that are shared across two\ndifferent star maps. A constellation is defined as a group of stars. When trying\nto find out if a constellation is shared by two star maps, color and position do\nnot matter. However, all constellations would be oriented in the same direction.
