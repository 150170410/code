DAL5 continues to refine the file system's\ninterface and provides methods that should\nlook similar to what most programmers are\nused to working with. Files have still not\nbeen completely abstracted away and all\npath names must be given as relative to\nthe root. The path separator is defined\nin this module along with a list of\ncharacters for valid file and directory names.
