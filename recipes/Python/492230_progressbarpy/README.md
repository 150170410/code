Progress bars are popular when trying to\nshow how much of a job has been completed.\nIn my case, it was encrypting and decrypting\nfiles. A GUI interface was written, but\nsomething was lacking. How was the user of\nthe program supposed to know if the program\nwas doing its job? A progress bar seemed like\na good answer, so a simple GUI progress bar\nwas written using Tkinter.
