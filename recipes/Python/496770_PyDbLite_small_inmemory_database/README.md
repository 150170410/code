A small, fast, in-memory database management program\n\nThe database object supports the iterator protocol, so that requests can be expressed with list comprehensions or generator expressions instead of SQL. The equivalent of :\n\n    cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM table WHERE age=30")\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n\nis :\n\n    rows = table(age=30)\n\nThe module stores data in a cPickled file. Records are indexed by a unique record identifier, that can be used for direct access. Since operations are processed in memory they are extremely fast, nearly as fast as SQLite in the few tests I made, and MUCH faster than other pure-Python modules such as Gadfly or KirbyBase. An index can be created on a field to even speed up selections\n\nConcurrency control is supported by a version number set for each record\n\nComplete documentation is [here](http://www.pydblite.net)
