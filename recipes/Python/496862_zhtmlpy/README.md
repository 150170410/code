This recipe requires the z_matrix module.\nTwo classes are provided, HTML_Table and HTML_Month.\nHTML_Table can manage the generation of a table in HTML format.\nHTML_Month builds on top of HTML_Table and expands on its capabilities.\nIt allows for dynamically created tables that have the look of the selected month.
