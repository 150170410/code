The new Lego Mindstorms NXT brick has an on-board Bluetooth transceiver that can\nconnect to a serial port service on a PC.  The NXT uses a simple format to pass\nraw bytes between connected Bluetooth devices.  This interface allows the NXT\nbrick to be controlled from Python.  Robot programming in Python anyone?
