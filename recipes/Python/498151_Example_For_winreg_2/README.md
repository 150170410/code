This recipe is another example of how to use the winreg module.\nThe code had the first purpose of demonstrating the concept of\na graphical shell built in Python. The shell was easily modified\nto make use of the Window's registry but retains traces of its\noriginal method of operation (all of which has been commented out).\n\nThe program down below originally used the pickle module to save\nall of its settings when closing down. Now once the escape key is\npressed, this Python 2.5 program can use the module presented in\nrecipe 510392 to access Microsoft Window's Registry and store its\nsettings there. Check `do_exit` and `do_config` functions for usage.
