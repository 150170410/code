This recipe introduces a novel way of compressing\ntext and is meant primarily as an exercise. The\nprocedures work best on standard 7-BIT ASCII and\nworst on binary encoded data. Please note that\nfunction "encode" returns a string and a key\nthat must be passed to function "decode" in\norder recover the original data.
