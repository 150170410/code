The physics system used in this simulation is\nboth incomplete and incorrect. This recipe evolved\nfrom the Boids Simulation and was an early attempt\nto simulate bouncing balls in an area contained\nwith a force field on the sides and a floor on the\nbottom. The spheres will respond to movement of\nthe window and will bounce if accelerated upward\nquickly. This is primarily a recipe that I later\nbuilt off of to create better software later on.
