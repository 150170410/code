This program is an mutated version of Bouncing Balls\nDemonstration. Bombs fall to the floor, but if they\ntouch each other, they explode with velocity and are\nquickly repelled away from each other. All bombs are\nidentified with numbers and can be clicked to change\ncolors. If you wish to follow individual bombs, you\nmay wish to note their numbers. Otherwise, you may\nalso change their colors in an attempt to keep track\nof them.
