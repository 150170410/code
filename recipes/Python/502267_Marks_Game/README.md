The recipe is a direct descendant of the program presented here:\nhttp://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/502251\nThis program was created at the suggestion of "Mark" (a friend\nof mine), and so the game was named in his honor. A high score\ntable is supported and is automatically saved to and loaded from\na file if possible. The object of the game is to click on each\nball until it is purple. The score is based on how many seconds\nare left on the clock in the bottom, left corner of the screen.\nHave fun, and try to beat the game in sixty seconds or less; it\nis possible!
