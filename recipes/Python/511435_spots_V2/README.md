This recipe is the core of something called FDR\n(Full Duplex RPC). FDR has not been completed at\nthis time, but the "spots" module takes most of\nthe work off of other modules in network chatter.\nThis is the second version of "spots" and simplifies\nthe ZSP class while getting rid of the base255 module.
