Given a list of cities, this recipe fetches their latitudes and longitudes from\none website (a database used for astrology, of all things) and uses them to\nbuild a URL for another website which creates a map highlighting the cities\nagainst the outlines of continents. Maybe some day it will be clever enough to\nload the latitudes and longitudes as waypoints into your GPS receiver.
