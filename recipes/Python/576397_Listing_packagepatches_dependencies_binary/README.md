Print (1) packages used by a binary, and (2) the list of installed patches\nrelated to these packages. If you have a binary that works with Solaris 10 update N, but doesn't with Solaris 10 update N-2, run this script on both platform and it will help you to find the patches you're looking for.\n \n(1) is retrieved:\n\n * By using pldd(pid) on the process you want to trace to get a list of loaded\n   shared library \n * By retrieving in the main /var/sadm/install/contents database\n   the list of package related to these shared libraries\n\n(2) is retrieved by parsing the output of the showrev -p command, given as\ninput of this script
