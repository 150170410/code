NOTE: This recipe has been updated with suggested improvements since the last revision.\n\nThis is a simple web crawler I wrote to\ntest websites and links. It will traverse\nall links found to any given depth.\n\nSee --help for usage.\n\nI'm posting this recipe as this kind of\nproblem has been asked on the Python\nMailing List a number of times... I\nthought I'd share my simple little\nimplementation based on the standard\nlibrary and BeautifulSoup.\n\n--JamesMills
