Small module to and check for differences between 2 DB.\n\nIt will compare the table list, the tables structure and their content.\n\nWhen you run the program, you are ask if you want a detailed comparison.\nAs global comparison will list all the different tables, detailed comparison will output\nevery different record (and will take longer to run)
