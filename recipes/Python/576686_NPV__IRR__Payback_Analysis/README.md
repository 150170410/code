A few financial functions for quick analysis of an investment opportunity and a series of associated cashflows.\n\nAs a module, it currently provides straightforward and easy to understand implementations of the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period functions.\n\nAs a script, it provides a simple command line interface which integrates the above functions into a concise analysis of the investment opportunity.\n\n        usage: invest discount_rate [cashflow0, cashflow1, ..., cashflowN]\n            where \n                discount_rate is the rate used to discount future cashflows \n                                 to their present values\n                cashflow0 is the investment (always a negative value)\n                cashflow1 .. cashflowN values can be positive (net inflows) \n                                                     or\n                                                     negative (net outflows)\n\nHere is an example of actual usage and output:\n\n    $ ./invest 0.05 -10000 6000 6000 6000\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    year      0        1      2      3     \n    cashflow  -10,000  6,000  6,000  6,000 \n\n    Discount Rate: 5.0%\n\n    Payback: 1.67 years\n        IRR: 36.31%\n        NPV: 6339.49\n\n    ==> Approve Investment of 10,000\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n*Note*: A check of the output of the Microsoft Excel NPV function against that of the function implemented here reveals a curious discrepancy/bug in the way Excel calculates its NPV. For further details see: http://www.tvmcalcs.com/blog/comments/the_npv_function_doesnt_calculate_net_present_value/\n\nFurthermore, the method used to calculate the IRR is rough to say the least and fails at fewer than 3 entries. Please use the secant method along the lines of the following haskell code from (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Quiz/Internal_Rate_of_Return/Solution_Dolio) for greater accuracy.\n\n    secant :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Double\n    secant f delta = fst $ until err update (0,1)\n      where\n        update (x,y) = (x - (x - y) * f x / (f x - f y), x)\n        err (x,y) = abs (x - y) < delta\n\n    npv :: Double -> [Double] -> Double\n    npv i = sum . zipWith (\\t c -> c / (1 + i)**t) [0..]\n\n    irr :: [Double] -> Double\n    irr cashflows = secant (`npv` cashflows) (0.1**4)\n
