Presented in this recipe is a function **prop**, with that a property *myprop* can be created as simple as:\n\n    @prop\n    def myprop(): pass\n\nIt has only 7 lines of code, easy to understand, easy to customize, will make the code look much netter and will save you a lot of typing.\n \nSee discussion and the doc test string for more complicated usages.\n\nNote: This is a recipe created with python v.2.5.2.\n\n
