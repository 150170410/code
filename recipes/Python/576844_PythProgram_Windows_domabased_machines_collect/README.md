this is a python program Python Program for Windows domain based machines to collect usefull information , this can be very customizable to the type of information you'd want to collect.\nyou can force it to run on all machines using group policy, and each machine would create a file in a specific folder ( for simplicity here , no need to go to a database at this level) with the machine name , and containing such information\nfor example , this program collects local administrators on the machine( can be very usefull in security assesments or securing the corporate ) , a list of all the software installed on the machine \nalso other general information like machine name ,current logged on user , system time at script run time and domain that this machine belongs to\n\ni've ran it in practice and i was really amazed by the result , that i couldn't find with any other tool\nonce you get the idea ... you can go wild with your dreams and do anything you like\ni've also written a backend parser which parses the results and prints out a report with the required results\nthis program needs python for win32 installed\nthe program uses windows registery , win32 api\nif you will run this software by group policy , you don't have to install python and python for windows extenstions onto each clinet machine\nthere is a tool called py2exe which magically , complies the code into and exe and DLL files , that you can run the exe by group policy as a startup script\nplease excuse the qualtiy of the code , as i am not a programmer , i am sys admin
