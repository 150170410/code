A convenience script to update a pre-specified folder containing \nsubversion, mercurial, bazaar, and/or git source folders\n\nTo use it: \n    \n* change the 'src' variable below to point to your source folder\n\n* name this script to something appropriate (I call it 'update')\n    \n* put it into a directory on your PATH\n\n
