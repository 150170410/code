Longest common subsequence problem is a good example of dynamic programming, and also has its significance in biological applications.\n\nFor more information about LCS, please see:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem\n\nAlso, here, I use a 'cached' decorator to keep core algorithm neat. \nYou can see how great the decorator could be. :)\n\nAlso note that, this recipe is just a demonstration of LCS and the usage of a python decorator. However, the memory is not used very efficiently. If the problem is very large-scaled, it may lead to stack overflow or memory error. \n\nSo, do not use this recipe to deal with large-scaled problems. ;)
