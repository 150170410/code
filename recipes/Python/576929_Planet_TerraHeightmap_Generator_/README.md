The process is simply:\n1. Take a plane\n2. Cut out a shape\n3. Make it a little taller\n4. Repeat\n\n* Similar to the [spherical landscape](http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_landsp.htm) algorithm by Hugo Elias.\n* I found a combination of Ovals and Triangles to produce the best results.
