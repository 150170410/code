toast?\nok so im working on a program that takes a randomly generated word\nn scrambles all the letters out \n\nthen it spits out the letters (which are still scrambled)\nit will ask the users to type what they think the word is\nthey get 10 tries before they lose \n\n\nthe code so far has no bugs in it i just need to know the small piece / block of code \nthat will scramble the letters in randwrd (this will be seen in the code)
