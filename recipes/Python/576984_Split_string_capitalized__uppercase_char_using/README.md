By user http://code.activestate.com/recipes/users/2629617/ in comment on http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440698/ but modified slightly.\n\nSplits any string on upper case characters.\n\nEx.\n>>> print split_uppercase("thisIsIt and SoIsThis")\nthis Is It and  So Is This\n\nnote the two spaces after 'and'\n
