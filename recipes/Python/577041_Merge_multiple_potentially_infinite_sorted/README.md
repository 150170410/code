Merge a (possibly infinite) number of already sorted inputs (each of possibly infinite length) into a single sorted output.\n\nSimilar to heapq.merge and sorted(itertools.chain(*iterables)).\n\nLike heapq.merge, returns a generator, does not pull the data into memory all at once, and assumes that each of the input iterables is already sorted (smallest to largest).\n\nUnlike heapq.merge, accepts an infinite number of input iterables, but requires all of them to come in ascending order (that is, their starting point must come in ascending order).\n\nIn addition, accepts a *key* function (like `sorted`, `min`, `max`, etc.)\n
