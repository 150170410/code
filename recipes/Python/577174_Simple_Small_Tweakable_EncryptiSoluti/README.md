Encryption can sometimes be a nightmare, at least is my experience while Python has \nsome excellent resources for encryption I found myself a lot of times needing an\nencryption solution that could port easily between VS C++, .NET, PHP, and Python\nprojects that would be simple to implement and  not rely on large bloated \ncrypto libs.
