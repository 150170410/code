This is a simple interface to a collection of classes which serialize Python objects to XML and back.\n\nThis is one part of a trio of recipes:\n\n* [Simple API](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577266)\n* [XML2Py De-serialization](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577267)\n* [Py2XML Serialization](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577268)\n\n
