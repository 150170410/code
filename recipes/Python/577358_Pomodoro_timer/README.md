A simple script that works as a pomodoro timer. Useful to enhance ones focus while working on something. \nThe Pomodoro technique is described at http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/\n\nThis script is an offline version of http://www.focusboosterapp.com/live.cfm\n\nIt requires the [Mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de/) program to play the audio and I obtained the ticking sounds from http://www.soundjay.com/clock-sounds-1.html
