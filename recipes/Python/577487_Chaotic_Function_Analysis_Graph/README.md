There are 3 chaotic functions to graph as examples.\n\nGraph of function (0) is a curve.\nGraph of function (1) is a group of lines.\n(Both are Xn+1 = f(Xn) type functions.)\n\nGraph of function (2) on the other hand is a plane.\n(It is Xn+1 = f(Xn, Xn-1) type function.)\n\nThese mean there is a simple relationship between the \nprevious and next X values in (0) and (1). (Next X value can always be predicted from the previous X value by using the graph of the function w/o knowing the function itself.) \nBut (2) does not have a discernible relationship. (No prediction possible!) \nSo (2) is clearly more chaotic than others.\n(I think it could be used as a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).)
