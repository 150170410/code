Wrote some simple implementation of pool for pymongo package under gevent coroutine library.\n\nBase bug here was with pymongo.connection.Pool because in the original package it is thread-local, so when you spawn new greenlet and trying to get already open connection, it creates new connection because in this greenlet pool is empty. So if you will implement your own pool donâ€™t forget about this.\n\n#Example of use:\n    # Create Pool. \n    db = Mongo('test_db',10)\n    # Get connection from pool\n    conn = db.get_conn()\n    # Get raw connection for GridFS\n    raw_conn = conn.getDB\n\n    #Mongo is a singleton. So if you want to get connection in another part of application just type\n    db = Mongo()\n    conn = db.get_conn()\n\n    #Connection will get back to pool when context will be closed.
