This very simple DEMO code records a few seconds of your voice from a microphone, (internal mic' on a laptop), and\nreplays your voice immedaiately after recording. It goes without saying that the RAW recording can be saved in\nany extension of your choice and used as error reporting using the playback method.\n\nThere is the possibility of using it as a simple means of a single channel audio oscilloscope using the external\nmic input and suitable Python GUI or with simple home built HW a seismometer recorder, plus other ideas.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nRead the code for more information...\n\n73...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n\nTeam AMIGA...
