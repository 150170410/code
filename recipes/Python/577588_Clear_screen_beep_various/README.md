This little module gives a clear screen and beep for the classic AMIGA, WinUAE, Windows and Linux all in\nCLI/Command-Prompt/Terminal mode.\n\nIt works from Python 1.4.x to 2.7.x; talk about backwards compatibility... ;oD\nWith very little modification it will work on Python 3.x.x easily.)\n\nSee the file clsbeep.py attached for more information.\n\nit is saved as clsbeep.py and placed into the Python - Lib drawer or where-ever the modules are located\nand called as a module:-\n\n>>> import clsbeep\n\nIts usage is:-\n\nclsbeep.cls() and clears the screen.\nclsbeep.beep() and creates an error beep.\nclsbeep.both() creates an error beep first then clears the screen.\n\nIt is Public Domain and if you modify it to suit other platforms please let me have a copy of your code... :)\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems. ;o)
