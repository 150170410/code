..For STANDARD Python 2.6 and above...\n\nThis code will display a horizontal full colour analogue "VU" style meter. It displays green for normal, yellow\nfor warning and red for danger with a critical error beep near the end of full scale, at value 120+.\n\nThis version is for Python 2.6 and above and only for the Linux, (*nix?), platform.\n\nIt is an "at a glance" display that is in colour rather than having to read say a digitally generated number.\n\nA Python 3.x version can be found here:-\n\nhttp://www.linuxformat.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=13443\n\nThis has uses "for at a glance" voltmeters, ammeters, data-loggers, anemometers etc, etc...\n\nWatch for wordwrapping etc...\n\nNOTE:- This is Public Domain and you may do with it as you please.\n\n73...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n\nTeam AMIGA...\n
