This is one of a few Arduino Python snippets to come your way. This one is DEDICATED entirely to the classic stock\nAMIGA A1200HD emulation inside WinUAE. With a small hardware modification it WILL work on a genuine stock AMIGA\nA1200HD also see inside the code for more information.\n\nIt only requires an ancient version of SATNDARD Python 1.4.x as an absolute minimum, and yes I know it is ancient,\nbut hey, the classic AMIGA is still capable of running Python to version 2.0.x; other AMIGA variants can run much\nnewer versions.\n\nOriginal copyright, (C)2008, B.Walker, G0LCU. NOW issued as entirely Public Domain...\n\nCertain assumptions have been made and are inside the code.\n\nAlso in the code box is the very basic Test.pde file to program the Arduino Diecimila Board with so that this\nworks.\n\nThere will be Linux and Windows versions coming that require only STANDARD Python also - NO pySerial is required\nAT ALL.\n\nSorry but you will need to split the two pieces of code below manually...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...
