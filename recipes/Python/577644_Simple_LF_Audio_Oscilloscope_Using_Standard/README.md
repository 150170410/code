AudioScope.py\n\nI think this might be a first for both Python.\n\nInitially uploaded to LXF, now also here under the MIT licence.\n\nI am building a kids level seismometer and wanted to use standard Python inside Linux.\n\nThis DEMO code was my starter idea and looks as though using standard ASCII only might just work a real treat.\n\nI've issued it to LXF under the MIT licence for future reasons.\n\nIt doesn't look much on screen except that the waveform(s) shown is/are a basic visual, electrical representation\nof your voice. ;o)\n\nIt is possible to link the earphone socket on this notebook to the mic input and start the Audio Function\nGenerator, elsewhere in this site, in a separate Python terminal and see those waveforms inside the\nAudioScope.py`s own Python terminal.\n\nThis grabs a 1 second 8KB burst, and then displays it onto the Python terminal. The timebase, amplitude, trigger,\nsingle shot and others are not included but the main grab and display using /dev/dsp is shown. This can be made\nplatform independent by changing the /dev/dsp to something external like the Arduino Dev Board. This uses\nSTANDARD Python 2.5.x and later and tested on PCLinuxOS 2009 and Debian 6.0.0.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.\n\nBazza, G0LCU.
