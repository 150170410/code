A table driven routine generates a unit conversion module and a doctest file. The generated module uses the Decimal class to create unit conversion classes which uses class properties to perform the conversion. conversion.py supplies the following classes:\n    Distance\n    Area\n    Volumn\n    Time\n    Velocity\n    Acceleration\n    Mass\n    Force\n    Weight\n    Pressure\n    Frequency\n    Power\n    Temperature\n\nNew classes and additional units can easily be created by adding to the table.
