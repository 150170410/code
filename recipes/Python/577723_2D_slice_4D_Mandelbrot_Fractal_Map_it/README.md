This is a modification of code posted at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577715/ (r3)\n\nThe original code produces a png image using the PIL module.\nIt generates a Random 2D Slice of a 4D Mandelbrot Fractal.\n\nThis extends the program into 3D with Visual Python 5.4, running under Python 2.7.1\n\nChanging vp_flag from 0 to 1 will restore program to original functionality.\nThe program is interactive with keys q,w,e,r and x used to control visual points object.\n
