A Linux DEMO to show how to display a waveform using standard text mode Python.\nThe audio device /dev/dsp is used and must be available. Levels are set using the\nstandard audio mixers.\n\nJust feed a signal of say 300Hz to 3KHz, (normal voice spectrum), using say, the\ninternal mic, and watch the waveform appear inside the X-Y graticule.\n\nThis method WILL be used for a program proper and may be uploaded to this site\nin the future.\n\nRead the code for more information.\n\nThis code is Public Domain and you may do with it as you please.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.
