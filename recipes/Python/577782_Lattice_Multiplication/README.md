The documentation in the function explains the algorithm but there are additional pages which provide additional visual help:\n * http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52468.html\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm\n\nThe function can handle a string as well as a sequence of digits. The test function is just to have a basic verification.
