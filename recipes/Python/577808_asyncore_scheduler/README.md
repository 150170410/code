The thing I miss mostly in asyncore is a system for calling a function after a certain amount of time without blocking. This is crucial for simple tasks such as disconnecting a peer after a certain time of inactivity or more advanced use cases such as [bandwidth throttling](http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/tags/release-0.6.0/pyftpdlib/ftpserver.py#1048).\n\nThis recipe was initially inspired by Twisted's internet.base.DelayedCall class:\n\nhttp://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/last_vfs_and_web2/twisted/internet/base.py#L34\n \n...then included into pyftpdlib:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=72\n \n...and finally proposed for inclusion into asyncore:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue1641
