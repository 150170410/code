**Python Program to READ & WRITE Spss system files (.sav) (Linux,Mac or Windows)**\n\n* *Check https://pypi.python.org/pypi/savReaderWriter/ for the latest version (including the libraries!)*\n* Requires libspssdio.so.1 (LINUX) or libspssdio.dylib (MAC) or spssio32.dll (WINDOWS) plus associated libaries, which can be freely downloaded from:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home/wiki/We70df3195ec8_4f95_9773_42e448fa9029/page/Downloads%20for%20IBM%C2%AE%20SPSS%C2%AE%20Statistics?lang=en\n* It is recommended to download the v21 I/O files (required for writing zlib (.zsav) compressed files)\n* December 2012 (complete rewrite):\n- Added support for slicing, indexing, array slicing + other special methods\n- Added support for writing spss date fields\n- Added support for almost all meta data (missing values, sets, roles, etc.)\n- Added support for 64 bit Windows (tested with Win7) and other OSs\n  (z/Linux, Solaris, HP Linux, IBM AIX (untested though)\n- Added support for reading and writing zlib compressed (.zsav) files\n- Removed pesky segfault error when freeing memory\n- Removed errors related to encoding\n- Changed some Reader defaults (verbose=False, returnHeader=False)\n- Renamed SavDataDictionaryReader into SavHeaderReader\n\n\n**LINUX:**\n\n*Installation (tested on Linux Ubuntu 10):*\n* additional packages/files needed are: intel-icc8-libs_8.0-1_i386.deb,libicu32_3.2-3_i386.deb, libstdc++5_3.3.6-20_i386.deb, libirc.so.\n* Run the following commands in your terminal: sudo apt-get install intel-icc8-libs; sudo apt-get install libicu32; sudo apt-get install libstdc++5.\n* Then convert libirc.a (static) to libirc.so (dynamic), save in same location as libspssdio.so.1:\nar vx intel-icc8-libs_8.0-1_i386.deb; tar -xzvf data.tar.gz ./usr/lib/libirc.a; ar -x libirc.a.\n\n*Calling the program:*\n* In the TERMINAL  type: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/of/additional/sofiles; python /some/path/wrapperToProgram.py. You may also add ld_library_path to .bashrc\n* The wrapper starts with "from SavReaderWriter import *", followed by e.g. stuff from the if __name__ == '__main__' section\n\n**MAC OS:**\n* you must put all the dylib files that come with the IBM \nSPSS_Statistics_InputOutput_Modules_* package in the macos\ndirectory somewhere that OS X can find them\n* one simple way to accomplish this is to copy them to /usr/lib\n\n**WINDOWS:**\n* You can also find this dll in the installation directory of SPSS (although SPSS is _not_ needed!)\n* The .dll should be saved in the same location as this program.\n\n**USAGE:**\nSee docstrings + __main__ section
