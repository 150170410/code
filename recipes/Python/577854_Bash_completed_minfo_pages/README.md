The script it self is very self explaining - the task is simple.\n*NIX only unless with cygwin perhaps?\n\nTo start this open a terminal and strike the "Tab" key to get all possibilities (strike y, and strike the space key alot). Select all then Copy and save in "comms.txt"\nModify the file so ONLY the possiblities consume a line; no prompts or extra newlines.\n  (first line must be a command, the last line must be a command)\n\nSave the file ("~/Documents/bashing/comms.txt" is my path) then run this script in "~/Documents/bashing/".\n\nThis generates two (2) files: "bash_help_man.sh", "bash_help_info.sh".\n\nThen it runs these files: "bash bash_help_man.sh", "bash bash_help_info.sh".\n\nThis produces 2 files for every command (every line) in "comms.txt".\nAll manpages are wrote in "mans/", all infopages are wrote in "infos/"\n\nThere is now alot of files to read and organize; lets separate these by size.\nDirectories are under1kb, under2kb, etc.\n\nOnce complete do as you wish the files less than 128 kb;\nthese files are COPIED into there new respective home, I repeat COPIED.\n\nThe files 128 kb and higher ARE NOT copied to anywhere!
