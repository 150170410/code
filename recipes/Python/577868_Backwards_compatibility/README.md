Some example lines to add to any test code you write that work from Python 1.4.0 to 3.2.2 on various platforms.\nIt is all Public Domain and you can do with it as you please...\n\nThis is to go alongside this little snippet...\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/577836-raw_input-for-all-versions-of-python/?in=lang-python\n\nI really don't care how you vote and/or rate this as I try to write Python code for my usage\nto work on the platforms and versions inside the code.\n\nSome people will know this but MANY won't and there will be more to come that involve platform\nand version compatibility...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...\n\n(Watch out for wordwrapping, etc...)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
