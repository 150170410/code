\nSome example lines to add to any test code you write that work from Python 1.4.0 to 3.2.2\non various platforms.\n\nIt is all Public Domain and you can do with it as you please...\n\nI really don't care how you vote and/or rate this as I try to write Python code for my\nusage to work on the platforms and versions inside the code.\n\nSome people will know this but very MANY won't and there will be more to come that involve\nplatform and version compatibility...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...\n\n(Watch out for word wrapping, etc...)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n\n
