\n"execfile()" IS BACK!!!\n\nSome example lines to add to any test code you write that work from Python (1.4.0), 2.0.1 to 3.2.2\non various platforms.\n\nIt is all Public Domain and you can do with it as you please...\n\nI really don't care how you vote and/or rate this as I try to write Python code for my\nusage to work on the platforms and versions inside the code.\n\nThese are a little tongue in cheek so don't take them too seriously.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...\n\n(Watch out for wordwrapping, etc...)\n\nThis will probably be the last one of these uploads as the last one did not "take off".\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n\n
