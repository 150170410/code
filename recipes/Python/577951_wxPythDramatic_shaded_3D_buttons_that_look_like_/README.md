These buttons work like regular wx buttons and can be used the same way.\n\nThey are very dramatic and add a strong visual and artistic flair to your interface.\nUse when there is something really significant and a regular button just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe buttons are drawn with gradient shading (no bitmaps).  They can be any size and support any font.\n\nThis source has a self-test.  Just run "python roundbutton.py".
