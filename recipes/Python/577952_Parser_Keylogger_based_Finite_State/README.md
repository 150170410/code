This program parses the logfile given by the execution of the keylogger \ncommand **'script -c "xinput test ID_CODE" | cat LOG_FILE'** and\nit is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage all \nthe possible combinations of the modifiers that represent the state of the FSM.\nThe parser gets the mapping between the couple of keycode and modifier typed \nand the corresponding char by xmodmap command. The parser is able to manage also extended \ncombinations such as Control or Super that don't give a real char.\nTo introduce new possible states that represent new combinations between modifiers,\nit's just necessary to update the list of state (*mod_keys*) and add new rules in the transition function properly.\nFor example to introduce the Caps Lock state just add it in mod_keys and the data structure transition has to handle \nthe release event of the corresponding key.\nFor the dependency of xmodmap the parser works only in X11 based systems.
