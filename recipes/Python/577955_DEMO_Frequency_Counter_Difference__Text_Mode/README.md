Hi experts...\n\nI think that this is a first... ;o)\n\nAnother kids level project to do for yourselves...\n\nThis is yet another Python DEMO to show the power of the sound card using\nLinux as an audio frequency counter.\n\nIt is a kids level project that uses the sound card as an input through the\nmicrophone socket to measure up to >3500Hz from a symmetrical waveform, sine\nsquare or triangle. See the comments inside the code for more details...\n\nThe only external hardware required is a test lead; oh my, this is technical\nstuff... ;o)\n\nThis is for Python 2.x.x, (probably even down to 1.5.2) but it would be\njust as easy to make it work on 3.x.x. I've already done it......\n\n......But I'll let the big guns do that for you...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...\n\nBe aware of word wrapping etc...\n\nBazza,  G0LCU...\n\n
