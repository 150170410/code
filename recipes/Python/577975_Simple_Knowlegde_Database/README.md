**What's the idea?**\n * The idea is to be able to ask more successful questions than data provided.\n * To have a kind of simple database\n\n**How is this done?**\n * A releationship is always though as a from of older/younger or bigger/smaller. You have to define those opposite meanings by calling 'defineAntagonism'\n * After this you can define a relationship by calling 'defineRelationship' using one of the opposite meanings and two ... I say names (can be persons or objects)\n * When you define that somebody/someting is bigger than somebody/something else then you implicitly provide two information (bigger <-> smaller)\n * Also when defining - more commonly explained - that A > B and B > C then also A > C and C < A. \n * That's the main logic implemented by this python code.\n\n**Special notes**\n * We have to avoid inconsistent data; when it is defined that A > B then you are not allowed to say that B > A.\n * We have to sort relations because they build up - I name it like this - a dependency chain. When a query checks for A > C but A > B and B > C is defined only we need an order for searching.
