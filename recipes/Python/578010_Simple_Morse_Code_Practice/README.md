This is not for the big guns, but for the Amateur coder AND radio enthusiast.\n\nIt is a DEMO Morse Code Practice Oscillator that will allow the user to practice\nsending Morse code using the "o" and "p" keys as a PSEUDO-paddle key. It is set to\naround 8 WPM, (Words Per Minute). The code allows "O" and "P" to be used at around\n12 WPM, when "Caps Lock" is turned on. Read the code for more informtion.\n\nIt is for at least standard text mode Python 2.5.2 to 2.7.2 using PCLinuxOS 2009 and\nDebian 6.0.0. It may well work at a much earlier version. I do have a version for\nPython 3.x.x but that will be uploaded elsewhere.\n\nIt is written in such a way that youngsters can understand what is going on.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
