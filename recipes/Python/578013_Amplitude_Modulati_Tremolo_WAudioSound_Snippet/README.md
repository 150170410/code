This IS for the big guns as well as the amatuer...\n\nI am always being told that too many comments inside any code is bad and that professional coders are clever enough to work out what a program does without comments...\n\nSo here goes! This snippet of code hits /dev/dsp in Linux and has no comments as to what it does.\nMake sure that /dev/dsp is available in your Linux install - if not then install oss.compat from your repository.\n\nIt needs Python 2.6 minimum, but may well work on a much earlier version\n\nDon't run the code first but have a go at working out what it does and see if you are correct... ;o)\n\nYou can email me if you think you are/were correct:-   wisecracker_at_tesco.net\n\nBear in mind I don't think this has ever been done before by hitting the /dev/dsp __directly__.\n\nNOTE:- NO imports are required at all!!!\n\nIt runs for about 7 seconds before exiting...\n\nAnother BIG PLUS for Linux.\n\n(I have a feeling poeple on here might like this, possibly even vote it up. ;)\n\nAnswer now at the bottom of this page...\n\nEnjoy...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
