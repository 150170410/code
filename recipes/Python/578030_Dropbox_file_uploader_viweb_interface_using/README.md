UPDATE:\nThis is script is not maintained and does not anymore with the current version of Dropbox. For a proper command line interface to dropbox I recommend `dropbox_uploader`: https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader\n\nOriginally inspired by the example at http://joncraton.org/blog/62/uploading-dropbox-python. \n\nThe script uses mechanize to logon to the web page and upload the file(s) to the Dropbox root folder or to the folder supplied on the command line as `dir:/my_dropbox_path` (if present, this must be the first parameter).\n\nMultiple files and/or glob patterns names are accepted as script arguments.\n\nExample usage\n--------------\n\n    dropbox.py file1.txt                       # upload to root folder\n    dropbox.py dir:/Backups/2012 file1.txt     # upload to custom folder\n    dropbox.py dir:/Backups/2012 *.txt         # upload by file mask\n    dropbox.py dir:/Backups/2020 *             # upload all files in current dir\n\nLimitations: only files in current folder are processed, subfolders are ignored.\n\nNOTE\n----\n\nThe script requires the `mechanize` module - use `pip install mechanize` or `easy_install mechanize` to add it to your site-packages.\n\nNOTE2\n------\nI have found a cleaner way to manage dropbox files from the console - see the *dropbox-uploade*r script at https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader - it is a Bash script that works using the official Dropbox API rather than emulating a web browser.
