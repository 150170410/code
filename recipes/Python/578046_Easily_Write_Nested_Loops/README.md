The "nest" generator function in this module is provided to make writing\nnested loops easier to accomplish. Instead of writing a for loop at each\nlevel, one may call "nest" with each sequence as an argument and receive\nitems from the sequences correctly yielded back to the caller. A test is\nincluded at the bottom of this module to demonstrate how to use the code.
