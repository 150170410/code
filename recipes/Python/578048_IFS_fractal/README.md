I found this equation in Wikipedia page for "List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension".\nThe problem is how to calculate the scaling coefficients for any given IFS fractal.\nYou can see the heuristic I used in the code.\nIt gave correct values for all the fractals listed except for Centipede it gave 2.27.  \nI do not know its correct fractal dimension to compare though.\n
