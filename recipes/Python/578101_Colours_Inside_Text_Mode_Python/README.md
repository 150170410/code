A simple DEMO to show how to enhance Python inside a Terminal. This works on Classic AMIGAs, E-UAE,\nDebian Linux 6.0.0, PCLinuxOS 2009, Windows XP and Vista and WinUAE, from Python 1.4.0 to 3.3A2.\n\nDue to a complaint about my _fun_ upload recently I decided to post this so that the MANY can now\nfind out how to manipulate text inside a Python Terminal window so that it looks much better.\n\nRead the code for more information...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza...\n
