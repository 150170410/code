**What is it about?**\n\n * I need to say someting like *1 day ago*, *5 days ago*, *2 weeks ago*, ...\n * I can control to have it with/without milliseconds and microseconds.\n * I can use it automatically with current date and time or with a provide one.\n\n**Why?**\n\n * I need it for next revision of my recipe 578111.\n * I found recipes here and there but often it is always assumed that a month has 30 days and that a year has 365 days; this is not true. That's why I've left away months and years.
