Provide an easy method to manage program options among multiple versions.\n\nThis module contains two classes used to store application settings in such a\nway that multiple file versions can possibly coexist with each other. Loading\nand saving settings is designed to preserve as much data between versions. An\nerror is generated on loading if saving would lead to any data being lost.
