The [parity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation) of a given permutation is whether an odd or even number of swaps between any two elements are needed to transform the given permutation to the first permutation.\n\nThe sign of the permutation is +1 for an even parity and -1 for an odd parity.\n\nThis python function returns the sign of a permutation of all the integers 0..N. \nWhen the program is run it shows the sign of permutations as generated by the standard  function itertools.permutations.\n\nThe function uses a modified [selection sort](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Selection_sort#Python) to compute the parity.
