For AMIGA-Heads Only...\n\nThis code is purely for a minimum of a stock Classic AMIGA A1200(HD), E-UAE, and WinUAE running AMIGA OS3.0x to 3.1x.\nIt will NOT work on any other platform!\n\n(It MIGHT work on AMIGA OS3.5x and 3.9x with Python 2.4.6, but totally untested and I hold no responsibility for the outcome when trying it.)\n\nIt is a DEMO to poke a byte inside _ANY_ memory address inside the standard CPU 68EC020 16MB boundary.\n\nThis is not a function nor a class but just a DEMO to show how to write directly to HW, (or memory), addresses.\n\nPOKING memory or hardware addresses is not recommended for novices without studying the machine first, and, this code will ignore any _ENFORCER_hits_.\n\nI experimented with this several years ago and have decided to finally release it. I do await the flak!\n\nIt works from Python Versions 1.4.0 to 2.0.1 for the classic AMIGA.\n\nThis is issued as Public Domain and you may do with it as you please.\n\nEnsure that the T: Volume exists on the running machine.\n\nSee inside the code and text below it also as to how it works...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
