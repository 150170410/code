A common model used in the financial industry for modelling the short rate (think overnight rate, but actually an infinitesimally short amount of time) is the Vasicek model. #\nAlthough it is unlikely to perfectly fit the yield curve, it has some nice properties that make it a good model to work with. \nThe dynamics of the Vasicek model are describe below.\n\nIn this model, the parameters  are constants, and the random motion is generated by the Q measure Brownian motion . \nAn important property of the Vasicek model is that the interest rate is mean reverting to , and the tendency to revert is controlled by . \nAlso, this process is a diffusion process, hence Markovian, which will lead to some nice closed form formulas. \nFinally, the future value of the interest rate is normally distributed with the distribution .\n
