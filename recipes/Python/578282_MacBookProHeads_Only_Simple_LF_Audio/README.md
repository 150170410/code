\nFor MacBook_Pro-Heads Only. Simple LF Audio Oscilloscope Using Standard Text Mode Python.\n\nSimpleScope_OSX.py\n\nDo you remember this upload from myself on 26-06-2011...\n\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/577771-simple-lf-audio-oscilloscope-using-standard-text-m/?in=user-4177147\n\nWell here is an August 2012 vintage MacBook Pro 13 inch version of it for OSX 10.7.5...\n\nThis is proof of concept code for a kids level project I am doing for a MacBook Pro, 13 inch, OSX 10.7.5.\nA DEMO to show how to display a waveform using standard text mode Python.\n"pyaudio" must be installed for this to work.\nLevels are set using the standard audio mixers, (System Preferences -> Sound).\n\nJust whistle a signal of say 300Hz to 3KHz, (normal voice spectrum), using say, the internal mic, and watch a waveform appear inside the X-Y graticule.\n\nRead the code for more information.\n\n$VER: SimpleScope_OSX.py_Version_0.00.10_(C)2012_B.Walker_G0LCU.\n\nThis code is GPL2, but, the hardware information is Public Domain.\n\n(I am looking into including Windows and Linux variants too using pyaudio to access the sound system.)\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
