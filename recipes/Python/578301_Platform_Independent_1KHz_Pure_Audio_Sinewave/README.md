IKHz_SW_OSX.py\n\nA mono _pure_ sinewave generator using standard text mode Python 2.6.7 to at least 2.7.3.\n\nThis DEMO kids level 1KHz generator is mainly for a MacBook Pro, (13 inch in my case),\nOSX 10.7.5 and above. See below...\n\nIt is another simple piece of testgear for the young amateur electronics enthusiast and\nuses pyaudio fully installed for it to work.\n\nPyAudio can be obtained from here:- http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/\n\nThis was primarily for a MacBook Pro, but works on at least 2 Linux flavours and Windows Vista 32 bit...\n\nThe sinewave generated is near excellent...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...
