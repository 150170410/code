This code is a derivative of the Pure Sinewave Generator and produces a continuous noise out of the speakers or headphone sockets.\n\nIt is for the hobbyist to be able to generate a pseudo-random noise signal for testing with.\n\nIt is issued as Public Domian and you may do with it as you please.\n\nIt is very easy to convert to Python 3.x.x but as OSX only has 2.7.x and lower ATM then these are what are used...\n\nAn installation of pyaudio IS needed for this to work; see the code for more information.\n\nIt is near platform independent but sadly the AMIGA is not included, but hey, I have already shown how generate sound for Classic AMIGAs.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
