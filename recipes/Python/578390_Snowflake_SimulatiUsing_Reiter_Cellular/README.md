This algorithm can create realistic looking snow crystals depending on the parameter values.\n(You can see good examples in the original paper by the author.)\n\nI also added coloring.\n\nWarning: Using current settings it takes about 30 minutes to run.\nI also do not recommend running it using IDLE.
