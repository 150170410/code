Basemap is a toolkit of matplotlib used to plot geographic maps.\n\nWith this function you can:\n\n* Draw the latitude/longitude grid easily in one line of code, specifying the lat/lon intervals.\n\n* Use rcParams, so all your figures will look more consistent.\n\n* Specify the label pad *in points* (instead of projection units).\n\n* Place the labels indicating which margins will be used.\n
