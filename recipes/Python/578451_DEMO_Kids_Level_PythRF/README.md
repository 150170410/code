This code is a DEMO RF Attenuator for SW listeners.\n\n(The code is to show how to generate the same waveform in each channel but in antiphase, as bridge output. The RF Attenuator is just a byproduct...)\n\nThe circuit has an insertion loss of about 10dB at full gain but that doesn't matter as it IS an attenuator after all.\n\nIt is another learning tool for kids to build and code for themselves.\n\nThe only common user I/O on desktops, netbooks, laptops and current MacBooks is/are the Audio Mic and Ear sockets...\n\nThis goes for "mobiles" too...\n\nThe circuit inside the code is so easy a 10 year old could have a working unit inisde 2 hours to experiment with...\n\nPyAudio IS needed for this to work and although originally designed around a MacBook Pro 13 inch OSX 10.7.5 and Python 2.6.7 has shown itself to be near platform independent...\n\nRead the code for much more information...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
