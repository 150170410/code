Inspired by various threads[1] on the python-ideas list, here's a simple enum type.  Enums are generated either via the class syntax or via Enum.make().\n\n    class Breakfast(Enum):\n        SPAM, HAM, EGGS\n        BACON, SAUSAGE\n\n    Breakfast = Enum.make("SPAM HAM EGGS BACON SAUSAGE")\n\nHere are some of the features:\n\nEnum:\n* inheriting from an enum inherits copies of its values.\n* the export() method allows for exposing an enum's values in another namespace.\n\nEnum Values:\n* the underlying values within an enum are essentially useless, diminishing the temptation to rely on them.\n* identity is equality, like with None, True, and False.\n* enum values support bitwise operations within the same enum.\n* the result of a bitwise operation is always the same object given the same inputs.\n\n[1] see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2013-January/019003.html
