This recipe is an emulator of the Oracle SQL\\*Plus, but it does things in a more friendly way ;).\n\nIf you need a client to access your Oracle but you don't like SQL\\*Plus, try this one.\n\nThis recipe was inspired by James Thiele's Console built with Cmd object recipe.\n\nIt provides a 'help' facility and supplies command completion when you hit the 'tab' key.\n\nIn addition you can use command line editing and history keys.\n\nHere are the commands that you can use:\n\n    ========================================\n    Documented commands (type help <topic>):\n    ========================================\n    constraints  edit      help     input   sequences  shell\n    db           exit      history  output  set        tables\n    desc         foreigns  index    quit    settings   triggers\n\n\nYou can edit the queries using 'vim' or any other editor.\n\nThe command 'output' can redirect output to a file and command 'input' can input commands from a file.\n\nThere's paginated output.\n\nThe command 'shell' or '!' allow you to perform operating system commands.\n\nYou can add commands by defining methods with names of the form 'do_xxx()' where 'xxx' is\nthe name of the command you wish to add.\n\nThere is a configuration file (.sql+) where you need to enter the dburi, editor name and other\nsettings.\n\n
