It simulates reflections of a ball on a billiards table that has one or more circular obstacles.\n(This can also be thought as a 2d ray-tracing.)\n\nMost of the time the path of the ball would be chaotic (meaning, if another ball started from any slightly different location or direction then its path would be very different after a short while). \n\nSee Wikipedia for more info:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards\n
