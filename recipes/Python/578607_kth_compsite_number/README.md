Found this Interview question. Here is my solution to it.\n\nAssume f(x,y,z) =  a^x * b^y * c^z\n\nThe x, y and z are integers larger than or equal to zero. Find the kth number in the series this function produces.\n\n\n\nCheck out my blog [Captain DeadBones Chronicles](http://thelivingpearl.com/)
