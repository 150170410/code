This is a DEMO to switch a *NIX terminal from text to _graphics_ mode on the fly.\n\nThe graphics characters are limited to lowercase 'a' through 'z' and\nthis DEMO just prints a small subset to see what a fun, kids level, 8\nchannel Logic-Analyser/Digital-Oscilloscope might look like.\n\nThis may not work in every *NIX style terminal but does work on default\nterminals using bash on OSX 10.7.5, PCLinuxOS 2009 and Debian Linux 6.0.x.\n\nTested on Python 2.5.x to 3.3.2 on the above platforms...\n(It might work on earlier versions of Python but untested.)\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza...
