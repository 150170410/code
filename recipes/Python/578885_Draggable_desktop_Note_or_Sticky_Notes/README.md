Inspired by "A-Note": http://a-note.sourceforge.net/\n\nAnd based on these tricks: \n\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11544187/tkinter-resize-text-to-contents\n\nBut here I am using my improved version of the automatic resized Text widget:\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/578886-automatic-resized-text-widget-tkinter/\n\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6104991/transparent-colors-tkinter\n\nFeatures:\n- The note is draggable\n- You can minimize the note at the left side of the screen or maximize it\n- You can hide the contents of the note\n- Hotkeys to save content of note to a file, open content of file inside a note and show help.\n\nPlease, comment me whether you see some bug.
