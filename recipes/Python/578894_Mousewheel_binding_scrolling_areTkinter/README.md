The behaviour of the mouse wheel is similar to the one on Windows.\n\nI tested this program on Windows 7 and on Linux Mint 17. Please let me know if this code doesn't work on your platform. I will appreciate any comments.\n\nThis is a practical application of this recipe: a scrolling frame with mouse wheel support.\n\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/580640-scrolling-frame-with-mouse-wheel-support
