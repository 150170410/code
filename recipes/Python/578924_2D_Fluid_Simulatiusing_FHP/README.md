2D Fluid Simulation using FHP LGCA (Lattice Gas Cellular Automata)\n\nSimulates fluid flow in a circular channel.\n\nIt works really slow but I think it can be a lot faster if it modified for NumPy and possibly Py2Exe.\n\nBut my main goal was to provide easy to understand code (not performance) anyway. \n
