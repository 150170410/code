sinebeep.py\n\nCreating an audio file called...\n\nbeep.wav\n\n...that can be played using almost ANY audio player available.\n\nThis simple snippet of code generates a 1 second sinewave WAVE file.\nIt IS saved inside the CURRENT drawer so that you can find it... ;o)\n\nThis works on:-\nClassic stock AMIGA A1200, using Python 1.4.0.\nWinUAE and E-UAE, AmigaOS 3.0.x using Python 1.4.0 to 2.0.1.\nWindows, to at least 7, using Python 2.0.1 to 3.3.2.\nVarious Linux flavours using Python 2.4.6 to 3.2.2.\nApple OSX 10.7.x and above using Python 2.5.6 to 3.4.1.\n\nThe file size is 8044 bytes and _IF_ you need to it can be palyed directly\nwithout a player on some Linux flavours that have the /dev/dsp device.\nIt is an 8 bit, unsigned integer, mono, 8000Hz sampling speed 8000 byte\nRAW file with the WAVE header added.\n\nIt will still work with PulseAudio and OSS using...\n\ncat /full/path/to/beep.wav > /dev/dsp\n\n...but with a momenatry click due to the 44 header bytes; but hey it is\na beep alternative...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.\n\nBazza.
