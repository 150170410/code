As one accumulates multiple drives, hard and flash, containing,\nthousands even millions of files, it becomes useful to have a text file\ncontaining an alphabetized catalog list of all files and their locations \nby drive and directory.\n\nThe list can be searched by eye or by an editor to locate particular\nfiles.\n\nThe list can also be loaded into a script to be filtered \nprogrammatically as desired.
