\nThis recipe shows how to do a batch conversion of the content of multiple text files into a single PDF file, with a) an automatic page break after the content of each text file (in the PDF output), b) page numbering, and c) a header and footer on each page.\n\nIt uses the fileinput module (part of the Python standard library), and xtopdf, a Python library for conversion of other formats to PDF.\n\nxtopdf is available here: https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram/xtopdf\n\nand a guide to installing and using xtopdf is here:\n\nhttp://jugad2.blogspot.in/2012/07/guide-to-installing-and-using-xtopdf.html\n\nHere is a sample run of the program:\n\npython BTTP123.pdf text1.txt text2.txt text3.txt\n\nThis will read the content from the three text files specified and write it into the PDF file specified, neatly formatted.\n\n\n
