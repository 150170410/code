\nThis recipe shows how to simulate an unless statement (a sort of reverse if, like Perl has), in Python. It is just for fun and as an experiment, not meant for real use, because the effect of unless can easily be got by negating the sense of the condition in an if statement.\n\nMore details and output here:\n\nhttps://jugad2.blogspot.in/2017/02/perl-like-unless-reverse-if-feature-in.html\n\n
