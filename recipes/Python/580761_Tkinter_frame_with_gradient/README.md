Frame with linear gradient using PIL. \n\nIt's also possible to make the same trick using tkinter PhotoImage.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10417524/why-is-photoimage-put-slow\n\nBut PIL is more efficient:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/nQ6YO-dTz10\n\nPossible values for **orient** are: *VERTICAL*, *HORIZONTAL*. If **orient** is "vertical", then width is mandatory. If **orient** is "horizontal", then height is mandatory. If **steps** is *None*, then the gradient is composed of adjacent lines.\n\nOne possible practical application of gradient frames are tool bars. Gradient guives a visual clue of when an area starts and when an area finish.
