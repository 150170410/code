\nThis is a follow-on to this recently posted recipe:\n\nImplementing function-based callbacks in Python:\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/580787-implementing-function-based-callbacks-in-python/?in=user-4173351\n\nThis new recipe shows how to create and use callbacks in Python, using classes with methods, instead of plain functions, as was done in the recipe linked above. All other points such as reasons and benefits for using callbacks, are more or less the same as mentioned in the previous recipe, except that class instances can carry state around, so to that extent, the two approaches are different.\n\nhttps://jugad2.blogspot.in/2017/04/python-callbacks-using-classes-and.html\n
