One of pythons greatest strengths is the ability to try things interactively at the interpreter.\nUsing Tkinter shares this strength, since one can create buttons, windows and other widgets,\nand instantly see them onscreen, click on buttons to activate callbacks and still be able to\nedit and add to the widgets from the python command line.\n\nWhile the python GTK bindings are generally excellent, one of their flaws is that this is not possible.\nBefore anything is actually displayed, the gtk.mainloop() function must be called, ending the\npossibility of interactive manipulation.\n\nThis recipe is a program which simulates a python interpreter which transparently allows the user to\nuse gtk widgets without having to call mainloop(), in much the same way as Tk widgets.\n\nThis latest version contains enhancements added by Christian Robottom Reis to add readline completion support.
