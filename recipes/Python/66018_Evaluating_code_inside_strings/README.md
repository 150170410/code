In Python, String and Unicode objects have one special operator: the % operator.\nWith that operator, strings can be formatted with format codes.\nFormatting is given syntax format % values, where format is a string with format codes that are replaced with values.\nWhen value is any kind of mapping, formats must include parenthesis that contain a key.\nAn item is fetched from directory with key or __getitem__ is overloaded with key.\nIn this example, Eval's __getitem__ returns the result of eval(key).
