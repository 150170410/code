I once tried to give Python something like C's enums, as described\nhere: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=G6qzLy.6Fo%40world.std.com\nThat approach tried to assign to a dictionary returned by the locals()\nfunction, intending that such assignments would become class attributes.\nThe Tim-bot explained to me the errors of my ways. The quest for the\nperfect Python enum goes on.
