This recipe shows the easiest way of handling access to sockets, serial ports\nand other asynchronous I/O ports while running a Tkinter based GUI.\nIt allows for a worker thread to block in a select(). Whenever something arrives\nit will received and inserted in a queue. The main (GUI) thread then polls\nthe queue 10 times per second (often enough so the user will not notice any\nsignificant delay), and processes all messages that have arrived.\n
