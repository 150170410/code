Installed ActiveTCL and executed the commands "teacup install --force Expect".\n\n\nI executed a script which will telnet to given ip.The following is the error.\n\n\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\n    while executing\n"spawn telnet $Machine".\n\nlet me know,anything missed ?\n\nThanks,\nSiva.
