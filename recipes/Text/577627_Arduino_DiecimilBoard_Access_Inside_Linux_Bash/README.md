The "code" in this recipe is a step by step "root" shell command line procedure for testing whether a(n) USB\nArduino Dev Board is working or not. To get more recognisable characters displayed it is best to use a\npotentiometer wired as one end to +5V, the other end to Gnd and thw wiper to ANALOG IN 0.\nThis has been tested on various Linux Distros and kept as simple as possible so that anyone can understand it.\n\nThe required ?.pde file for the Arduino Board can be found here:-\n\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/577625-arduino-diecimila-board-access-inside-winuae-demo/?in=lang-python\n\nIt is issued entirely as Public Domain by B.Walker, G0LCU, 30-03-2011, and you may do with it as you please.\n\nSimilar assumptions are made as in the URL above.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)
